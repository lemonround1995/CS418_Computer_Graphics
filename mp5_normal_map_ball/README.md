Nomal Mapping to Create A Magic Ball

## Modeling
(1) Generate a sphere by creating triangle meshes. </br>
(2) Use normal mapping image to render normal information to "change" the surface of the sphere. </br>

## Instructions on How to Use The Program:
Due to security reasons, some web browser prevent users reading local files including images. </br>
This project can successfully run in Firefox, but if you are using other browsers, in order to read local image files, </br>
you can: </br>

1. If you use the Brackets editor, the live preview function will start up a server (and browser) to test your code.</br>
Just have Chrome open, and the open your html file in Brackets. Click the lightning bolt icon in the top right of the Brackets window.</br> 

2. Alternatively, you can install node.js Then install and run httpserver to serve the directory that it is run from.</br>

3. This can also be done using Python. Run this command in your terminal in the directory you want to serve: </br>
(1) "python -m http.server 8000" (server number doesn't have to be 8000) </br>
(2) Then point your browser to "localhost:8000"</br>
