## Title
Simple Particle System: Bouncing Balls

## Modeling
(1) Balls: Use sphere model to generate balls with random colors and speeds. </br>
(2) Skybox: Use a cube to create a invisible skybox to simulate a room with 6 walls. </br>

## Particle System
This project will simulate the movements of balls after colliding on the walls. </br>

The balls are affected by 2 forces: </br>
(1) Gravity </br>
(2) Friction </br>

For the position of balls:</br>
(1) Update the position using the current velocity and Euler Integration. </br>
(2) Update the velocity using the two forces stated above.</br>

All the balls will be generated with a random color, position and velocity.</br>
