you can: </br>
</li> If you use the Brackets editor, the live preview function will start up a server (and browser) to test your code.
Just have Chrome open, and the open your html file in Brackets. Click the lightning bolt icon in the top right of the Brackets window.

</li> This can also be done using Python. Run this command in your terminal in the directory you want to serve: </br>
